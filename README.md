# getMusicFiles

This plugin was created to get all music files within metadata in our devices Android (4.x / 5.x), not implemented yet in 6.0, it cab be use to create a Music Player for example.

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

# Features
